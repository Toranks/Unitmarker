-----------------------------------

Unreleased Version
- packaged for 1.16/1.17 by sevu

Version 1.4.2
-Fixed the bug of Hero and Leader units getting the loyal Icon after "revert all changes"

Version 1.4.1
-Manually reshaded every pixel of the flag icon (finally happy with it)
-complete macro-rewrite to use objects for filtering (hopefully unlocking overlay storing)
-recoloring of leader crowns


Version 1.4 
-Unitmarkers now functions as modification as provided by the game on mp and single player on 1.13 and on mp on 1.12.
 In sp on 1.12 it still uses the hackery. This means that it can be turned off whereever it is a standard modification but of course,
 i can only recommend having it on ;)
 
-because of the code differences between 1.12 and 1.13, development has now officially stopped for 1.12. 
 Bugfixing for 1.12 is still active.
 
-smaller retouche of the flag icon

-partly rewritten description.


Version 1.3
-reorganization of the leader overlays (there are now even more available)
