    description=_"This is a modification for Wesnoth which will affect all your campaigns, also mainline ones. It adds a right-click menu that lets you label special units that you donâ€™t want to die with different overlays. Always recognise your important units! Loyal units, hero units and leaders get different sets of overlays."
